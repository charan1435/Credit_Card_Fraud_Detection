# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains (Highly Imbalanced) real-world anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine.

📂 Notebook Highlights:
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed to understand class imbalance and transaction patterns.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing: Scaling, feature selection, and dealing with imbalanced classes.

🧪 Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression – for interpretable baseline results

XGBoost Classifier – for powerful gradient boosting performance

Threshold Tuning – to optimize model precision and recall

📊 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

🧭 Conclusion: Model comparison and recommendation for real-world application.
